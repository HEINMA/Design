Today, the most iconic and familiar
relational databases include IBM DB2, Oracle
Database, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL,
and MySQL.

Structured Query Language, or SQL, was
invented at IBM soon after the introduction of
the relational database. Since its introduction,
SQL has become the most widely used
database language, used for querying data, data
manipulation (insert, update and delete), data
definition (schema creation and modification),
and data access control.

Times have changed. The advent of
smartphones, the ‘app economy,’ and cloud
computing in the late 2000s caused a seachange
in the workloads, query types, and traffic
patterns needed to support a global user base.

Latency issues can be addressed by shifting
data closer to the customer. To meet this
need, data must be replicated across different
geographic locations. Such geographical
replication turned out to be a struggle for
RDBMSs. While RDBMSs are not fit for
distributed deployments, non-relational
databases are designed specifically to support
such topologies
